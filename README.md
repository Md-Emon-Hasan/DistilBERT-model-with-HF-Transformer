# DistilBERT Model with Hugging Face Transformers
A basic implementation of **DistilBERT** using the Hugging Face Transformers library to demonstrate its capabilities for NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.

---

## Features
- Load and use pre-trained DistilBERT without custom fine-tuning.
- Perform text-based tasks out of the box.
- Simple and reusable implementation.

---

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- Transformers
- PyTorch

---

## Usage

### **1. Text Classification**
Use the pre-trained DistilBERT model to classify text:
```bash
python app.py --text "Enter your text here."
```

### **2. Tokenization**
Process text using DistilBERT's text similarity:
```bash
python app.py --text "Entet your text here."
```

---

## Project Structure
- `classify.py`: Script to classify text using pre-trained DistilBERT.
- `similarity.py`: Script to similarity input text.
